    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an Information Architect from Jakarta, Indonesia. I like the idea of connecting user with the content they needed. My area of expertise is within the information seeking and information behavior, information architecture, and usability.

        So you may wonder, what an information architect do ? Well in short, i define, create, or even analyze structural design of shared information environments. Because not all categorizations will be suitable or relevant to all users. Let me put in this perspective, tomatoes are botanically classed as berry-type fruits – but as the saying goes, “knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad”</p>
